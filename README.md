Requires *Chrome* or any other browser that supports both **WASM** and **WebUSB**

#### macOS
_it just works Â®_ ... no need to download or install any software.

#### Linux
To grant permission to the browser to access the USB device you'll need to add UDEV rules that grant access to a group called `plugdev`. You will also need to ensure your user is added to that `plugdev` group.
1. Copy https://github.com/glaubitz/linux-minidisc/blob/master/netmd/etc/netmd.rules into `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-netmd.rules`
2. Add yourself to the `plugdev` group (create the group if it doesn't exist)
```
$ groupadd plugdev
$ usermod -a -G plugdev YourUserName
```
3. Reboot
4. Plug-in your netmd device after loggin in.

Also note that you will need to use a browser packaged by your distro vendor; browsers installed via snap or flatpak wont work.

#### Windows 10
The Windows USB stack requires a driver to be installed to communicate with any USB device. The bad news is that there are no official Windows 10 drivers for NetMD devices. The good news is that we don't need it!
We can just use a generic driver like *WinUSB* to access the device.

You can find installation instruction [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/winusb-installation), but the easiest way to install is to use [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/).<br/> Note: you'll need to restart your browser after installation.

#### Chrome OS
Works without any addtional set up - tested with 91 stable (91.0.4472.102). If your user account or device is managed (by your school or company) you may run into some issues. If you are using a personal google account on a personal chromebook you should be good to go.

### How to build

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so you can run:
- `npm start` to start the development server
- `npm build` to build for production

WASM modules are provided in the `public/` directory. However, if you wish to build those binaries yourself, instructions are provided in the `extra/` directory.


### How to Contribute
Every contribute is welcome but, please, reach out to me before working on any PR. I've built this app mainly for personal use and I wish to keep it as light as possible in terms of features.

### Bugs and Issues
There might be plenty of them, for sure :) . The thing is that I've not the time to fix all of them and to make sure this app works on every browser or device.

The best way to get a bug fixed, a feature implemented, or a device supported, is to fork the project and do it for yourself. I'll try to provide support as best as I can.

### Backstory
A few weeks ago I've found my old [MZ-N710](https://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-N710.html) in the basement of my parents' house.

Determined to make it work on my modern Mac, after some googling, I found out about the [linux-minidisc](https://github.com/glaubitz/linux-minidisc) project. They've done an amazing job in reversing the NetMD protocol.

After a quick inspection to the source code I realized the project could be easily ported to javascript (either node and the browser) using the WebUSB api, so I created [netmd-js](https://github.com/cybercase/netmd-js). Then, on top of that I've built **Web MiniDisc** to manage the music on my device without the need of downloading and installing any dedicated software.

That's it. It was a LOT of fun :).

### Some OSS I've used
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [ffmpegjs](https://github.com/ffmpegjs/FFmpeg), to read audio files (wav, mp3, ogg, mp4, etc...).
- [Atracdenc](https://github.com/dcherednik/atracdenc/), to support atrac3 encoding (lp2, lp4 audio formats).
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), to run both FFmpeg and Atracdenc in the browser.
- [netmd-js](https://github.com/cybercase/netmd-js), to send commands to NetMD devices using Javascript.
- [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/), to build the user interface.
- [linux-minidisc](https://github.com/linux-minidisc/linux-minidisc), to build the netmd-js library.
